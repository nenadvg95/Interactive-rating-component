## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned
I have learned how to use "target" as a part of the object in anonymous function and use it to match the even that i expect with certain elements on the page such as buttons with class of ".circle" in this case. 
I must say that this was the first solution i found out in my javascript code that was more broad , complicated and not entirely thought trough but i still left the code there - commented as it is - in order to be reminder for myself as well maybe for someone who reads how target can be used for matching. Second written code is shorter and i think better.

### Continued development
After i finished i checked my solution agaist Thomas Sankara youtube channel - where he has this and many other Frontend mentor solutios available for help as well as for to check against.
